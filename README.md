# Teaching material for Causal ML
This repository consolidates the teaching material of several "Causal Machine Learning" courses I taught with a focus on impact/policy/program evaluation.

Like the whole literature the content is a moving target. Please let me know if you spot any errors, disagreements, but also if you found the material useful.
